        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>At Goatpaglu, we are committed to providing quality products and excellent customer service. This Cancellation and Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions regarding cancellations and refunds for purchases made through our website.</p>

        <h2>2. No Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>All sales made through Goatpaglu are final. We operate a strict <strong>NO REFUND</strong> policy. Once an order has been placed and confirmed, we do not offer refunds under any circumstances.</p>

        <p>This policy applies to all products sold on our platform, including but not limited to custom-designed t-shirts and other apparel items.</p>

        <h2>3. Order Cancellation</h2>
        <p>Due to the custom nature of our products, orders cannot be cancelled once they have been confirmed and sent for production. We recommend that customers carefully review their orders, including design, size, color, and quantity, before completing the purchase.</p>

        <p>If you wish to cancel an order, you must contact us immediately at the contact information provided below. We will make every effort to accommodate your request if the order has not yet entered the production phase. However, we cannot guarantee cancellation once the order is confirmed.</p>

        <h2>4. Defective or Incorrect Products</h2>
        <p>While we maintain a no refund policy, we stand behind the quality of our products. If you receive a product that is:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <li>Defective or damaged upon arrival</li>
            <li>Significantly different from what was ordered (wrong size, wrong design, wrong color)</li>
            <li>Not as described on our website</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Size and Fit Issues</h2>
        <p>We provide detailed size charts and product descriptions on our website to help you make informed purchasing decisions. We do not accept returns or offer refunds for size or fit issues. Please carefully review all product information before placing your order.</p>

        <h2>6. Change of Mind</h2>
        <p>We do not accept returns or offer refunds if you simply change your mind about a purchase. Please ensure you are satisfied with your selection before completing your order.</p>

        <h2>7. Shipping and Delivery</h2>
        <p>Delays in shipping or delivery do not qualify for refunds. However, if your order is significantly delayed beyond the estimated delivery time provided at checkout, please contact us, and we will work with you to resolve the issue.</p>

        <h2>8. Process for Reporting Issues</h2>
        <p>If you believe you have received a defective or incorrect product, please follow these steps:</p>
